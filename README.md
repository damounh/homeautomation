## Home Automation Projects
Using this repo to track the adventures of home automation. Below are the projects I've experimented

* [Automating a Line Voltage Thermostat using Home Assistant and Sonoff Basic R2 Switch](https://github.com/damounh/homeautomation/blob/main/smartLineVoltageThermostat.md)
* [Experimenting with ToF to build a direction sensor](https://github.com/damounh/homeautomation/blob/main/directionSensor.md)
